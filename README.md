## How to Play

To play the game, go [here](https://ammartens.github.io/Number-Guesser/). Pick a number between 0-9. Try to guess the number that will be the closest to the randomized mystery number. Whoever is closest, 
between you and the computer, wins! Hit the 'next round' button to play another round. The game will keep track of the ultimate score. Refresh the page to start over.
